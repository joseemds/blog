## Introduction

	I decided to read [Learn OpenGL](https:://learnopengl.com), so the first logical step was... setup the project! And... handling C projects can be a bit painful?
	I am not a C expert (neither a Nix expert), but i already saw a few C projects, a lot of than handle dependencies differently, vendoring, installing directly into your system..., and choose between Make, CMake and others that i didnt even know that existed was a bit overwhelming. Then i thought, why not try something more familiar!? A played with nix a bit and it seems a perfect fit for this task.

## But what is Nix?


## Setting up the development enviroment

```nix
{
  inputs.flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let
        inherit (pkgs) lib;
        pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
      in
      {
        defaultPackage = pkgs.hello;
        devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
          buildInputs = with pkgs; [
            glfw
            freeglut
            libGLU
            glew
            xorg.libX11
            xorg.libXrandr
            xorg.libXi
            libGL
            glm
						mesa.drivers
						glxinfo
          ];
        };
        formatter = pkgs.nixpkgs-fmt;
      }
    );
}
```
